This proposal has the benefit of not adding complexity to the geometric representations.
 
(a) the property type is named something like IfcPropertyMatrixValue, 
(b) it shouldand have the ability to represent 
    0. a single value, 
    1. a list (1D array) values, 
    2. a table (2Darray ) values, or 
    3. a volume (3D array) values 
(c) It should still have a unit property. 
(d) the Number parameters are implicit in the IfcPropertyMatrixValue values using sizeof() . 
(e) The Length parameters are implied by the property name matching the name of the geometric item. 

It is then an implementation  option to project the data onto the/a block representation.
